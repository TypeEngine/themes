To upload a template, package your index.html file and your assets folder, containing any template assets relatively linked to from index.html, into a ZIP file. The name of the ZIP is unimportant.

Log-in to the web console, and navigate to Publication > Design. Upload your ZIP file and name the template there.

Now, navigate to an article or create a new article. On the Article > Metadata screen, you can now select your new template. 

If the article is inside of an issue that is already published, and you'd like to republish the issue with the newly applied template (or an update to an existing template), you can navigate to the Issue Detail screen and click Republish.

Preview your rendered template in the TypeEngine preview app!
